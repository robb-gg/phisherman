# Scoring weights configuration for Phisherman analyzers
# This file allows A/B testing of different weight combinations

scorers:
  linear:
    # Analyzer weights (0.0 - 1.0 scale)
    weights:
      blacklist_feeds: 0.9    # Highest weight - known bad indicators
      dns_resolver: 0.8       # High weight - DNS reputation signals
      rdap_whois: 0.7        # Good weight - domain registration data
      url_heuristics: 0.6    # Moderate weight - pattern analysis
      tls_probe: 0.4         # Lower weight - placeholder analyzer

    # Risk level thresholds
    thresholds:
      low: 25.0      # 0-25 = very low risk
      medium: 50.0   # 25-50 = low risk, 50-75 = medium risk
      high: 75.0     # 75+ = high risk

    # Consensus adjustments
    consensus:
      high_risk_bonus: 15.0        # Bonus when 70%+ analyzers agree on high risk
      low_risk_penalty: 10.0       # Penalty when 70%+ analyzers agree on low risk
      disagreement_penalty: 5.0    # Penalty when analyzers strongly disagree

# A/B Testing configurations (future use)
experiments:
  conservative:
    # More conservative scoring - higher thresholds
